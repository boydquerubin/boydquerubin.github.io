      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p>
        I'm Boyd Querubin, a 32-year-old originally from the Philippines. I
        recently became a naturalized <br />
        citizen of the United States. I'm fluent in both English and Tagalog,
        speaking them both as if they <br />
        were my native languages.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm a husband and a father of three wonderful children. My journey
        started with a Communications <br />
        degree, and since graduating in 2019, I've been working as a
        Marketer/Content Creator. <br />
        However, I'm currently in the process of learning Web Design, as I'm
        planning to make a career change <br />
        in the near future. As part of this transition, I'm actively working on
        creating an Online Portfolio <br />
        from scratch, which is my current project.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time, I enjoy playing volleyball, learning to code, and
        spending quality time with my wife and kids.
